st.header("Background & Problem")
st.write("""As part of the CS 6460 course, Dr. Judith Uchidiuno assigned an in-depth project focused on enhancing educational technology applications with a primary emphasis on motivation. Motivation is critically important in the educational process, impacting both the intensity and persistence of a learner's engagement with a tool. Research from texts like "How Learning Works" and "How People Learn," underscores that motivation's role extends beyond merely attracting usersâ€”it is crucial in maintaining their engagement over time. Motivated learners are more inclined to tackle challenging tasks, utilize cognitive strategies, and achieve superior educational outcomes. This underscores the necessity of designing learning technologies that not only capture but sustain user engagement, interest, and effort.""")
st.header("Our Changes")
st.write("""We aimed to imrpove Duolingo. We understood that sustaining user motivation in digital learning environments is complex and influenced by a variety of factors, including user goals, content relevance, and personalization of the learning experience.
